# Car Scroll Animation - Frontend Project

Hello! This is my frontend project where I practiced creating a cool car animation that happens as you scroll down the page. I built this to learn how to use the **GSAP** library and the **ScrollTrigger** plugin for smooth web animations.

## � Project Goal
The main idea was to make a car drive across the screen and "reveal" some text behind it as it passes by. I also added some info boxes that appear at different heights while scrolling.

## ⭐ Features
- **Scrolling Car**: The car moves left and right based on your scroll behavior.
- **Auto-Reveal Text**: Each letter of "WELCOME" pops up exactly when the car goes over it.
- **Green Trail**: A line draws behind the car to show the path taken.
- **Fading Info Boxes**: Different stats fade in and out as you continue scrolling.

## 🛠️ Things I Used
- **HTML**: For the page structure and placing the car image.
- **CSS**: For styling the road, text boxes, and making sure the track stays on screen (Sticky positioning).
- **JavaScript (GSAP)**: This was the main part! I used GSAP to handle all the math for the car's position and the timing of the reveals.

## 📂 How to Open
1. Download the files.
2. Make sure you have the `assets` folder with the car image.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser! 
*(Note: It works best if you use a Live Server so the scripts load correctly).*

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use `position: sticky` in CSS.
- How to link GSAP libraries using a CDN.
- Basic logic for checking if an element has crossed a certain point on the screen.
